**Application Architecture: Poker Platform**

**1. Technology Stack:**
   - Frontend: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
   - Backend: Node.js, Express.js
   - Database: PostgreSQL with Sequelize (ORM)
   - Real-time Communication: Socket.IO
   - Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
   - Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), AWS EC2 (Backend), AWS RDS (Database)
   - Version Control: Git, GitHub
   - Project Management: Trello or Asana

**2. System Components:**

  **A. Presentation Layer (Next.js, Tailwind CSS)**
   - *Webclient:*
     - Landing/ signup/ login pages
     - Game lobby (list of available tables)
     - Game table (6-player poker table, with chat functionality)
     - User profile & settings
     - Transaction history (deposit/withdrawal)

  **B. Application Layer (Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO)**
   - *APIs:*
     - Authentication (signup, login, logout, profile management)
     - User management (Ã¥gats, balance, etc.)
     - Table management (create, join, leave, start, end)
     - Game logic (card distribution, betting, winning)
     - Payment processing (stripe, paypal, etc.)
   - *Socket.IO:*
     - Real-time communication (chat, game events)

  **C. Data Layer (PostgreSQL, Sequelize)**
   - *Database Schema:*
     - Users (id, email, password, balance, etc.)
     - Tables (id, user_id, table_name, max_players, current_players, status, etc.)
     - Games (id, table_id, game_start_time, game_end_time, winner, etc.)
     - Cards (id, suit, value)
     - Transactions (id, user_id, type, amount, timestamp)

**3. Application Flow:**

  **A. User Flow:**
   - Signup/Login
   - Deposit coins (if using real money)
   - Join/ Create table
   - Play poker
   - Withdraw winnings (if using real money)

  **B. Game Flow:**
   - User joins table (max 6 players)
   - Once table is full with players, game starts
   - Cards are dealt, and betting rounds begin (real-time updates via Socket.IO)
   - Once betting rounds are over, winner is determined and coins are distributed
   - Table ends, and a new table can be created or joined

**4. Deployment:**

  **A. Frontend Deployment (Vercel):**
   - Build the Next.js application
   - Deploy to Vercel with custom domain
   - Configure CDN and SSL

  **B. Backend Deployment (AWS EC2):**
   - Set up EC2 instance
   - Install dependencies (Node.js, Express.js, etc.)
   - Start the server, configure environment variables, and secure the instance

  **C. Database Deployment (AWS RDS):**
   - Set up RDS instance with PostgreSQL
   - Migrate the schema and insert initial data (if any)
   - Secure the database and configure backup strategy

**5. Scaling & Maintenance:**
   - Monitor application performance using tools like Application Insights or Datadog
   - Implement auto-scaling for backend and database using AWS technologies
   - Regularly update dependencies and packages to prevent security vulnerabilities
   - Perform routine backups and disaster recovery testing
   - Gather user feedback and continuously improve the application based on their needs

Poker Game Platform - System Architecture & Design
Since you want a fast, scalable, and cost-effective solution, here's a complete system design for your poker game platform.

1. Tech Stack
Since you already know Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS, I'll complement that with the best choices for each part:

Frontend:

Next.js (React framework for SSR & SEO benefits)
Tailwind CSS (for fast UI styling)
WebSockets (for real-time updates using Socket.IO)
Zustand or Redux (state management)
Backend:

Node.js (Fast event-driven backend)
NestJS (More structured than Express.js)
WebSockets (Socket.IO for real-time multiplayer gameplay)
Redis (For pub-sub mechanism in real-time communication)
PostgreSQL (Relational DB for structured data like users, transactions)
Prisma ORM (For database interaction)
Authentication:

NextAuth.js (for email, Google, or social logins)
JWT (for token-based authentication)
Bcrypt.js (for password hashing)
Infrastructure & DevOps:

Docker (for containerization)
AWS EC2 / Vercel (for hosting)
PostgreSQL on Supabase (free-tier DB hosting)
Cloudflare (for security & performance)
2. System Architecture
Frontend (Next.js)
User Authentication (Signup/Login using NextAuth.js)
Lobby System (List of poker tables, each with 6 players max)
Poker Game Interface (Real-time game updates using WebSockets)
Wallet & Coins System (Users receive free coins to play)
Leaderboards & Stats (Track wins, losses, total coins)
Settings & Profile Management
Backend (Node.js + NestJS)
Authentication API (JWT-based auth, NextAuth.js)
User Management (Signup, login, update profile)
Poker Game Engine (Handles poker logic, card shuffling, winner calculations)
WebSocket Server (Real-time game updates via Socket.IO)
Matchmaking System (Assigns users to tables automatically)
Transaction & Wallet System (Manage free coins, later real money)
Game History & Leaderboards (Records wins, losses, etc.)
Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
User Table
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
Wallet Table
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE wallets (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id),
  balance INTEGER DEFAULT 1000
);
Poker Table
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE poker_tables (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  table_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  max_players INTEGER DEFAULT 6,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
Game History
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE game_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  table_id UUID REFERENCES poker_tables(id),
  result VARCHAR(50), -- win, lose, fold
  earnings INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
3. Real-Time Gameplay (WebSockets + Redis)
Flow of a Poker Game:

User joins a poker table
Backend assigns the dealer & deals cards
Players make bets (fold, raise, call, check)
Game progresses turn by turn
Backend determines winner & updates wallet
Update leaderboard & history
ðŸ”¹ Redis Pub/Sub: Helps to broadcast game events (like bets, card reveals) efficiently.
ðŸ”¹ Socket.IO: Handles real-time game updates between players.

4. Deployment Plan
Frontend

Host Next.js on Vercel (Free-tier fast deployment)
Use Cloudflare for caching & protection
Backend

Deploy NestJS API on AWS EC2 / DigitalOcean
Use Docker to containerize services
Database

Use Supabase (PostgreSQL Free Tier)
WebSockets

Run a Socket.IO server on AWS EC2 with Redis
5. Monetization Plan (Later)
In-App Purchases (Users buy coins with real money)
Subscription Model (VIP access, special tournaments)
Ads & Sponsorships
Next Steps
âœ… Step 1: Set up Next.js with Tailwind
âœ… Step 2: Implement authentication with NextAuth.js
âœ… Step 3: Build the lobby system (list of tables)
âœ… Step 4: Set up the backend (NestJS + PostgreSQL)
âœ… Step 5: Implement WebSocket-based real-time poker engine
âœ… Step 6: Deploy using Docker, AWS, and Supabase

This is a scalable, cost-effective, and future-proof poker game architecture.
Would you like me to start building the Next.js frontend or the backend API first? ðŸš€
