NUMPYYYY
Why use NumPy?
Python lists are excellent, general-purpose containers. They can be ‚Äúheterogeneous‚Äù, meaning that they can contain elements of a variety of types, and they are quite fast when used to perform individual operations on a handful of elements.

Depending on the characteristics of the data and the types of operations that need to be performed, other containers may be more appropriate; by exploiting these characteristics, we can improve speed, reduce memory consumption, and offer a high-level syntax for performing a variety of common processing tasks. NumPy shines when there are large quantities of ‚Äúhomogeneous‚Äù (same-type) data to be processed on the CPU.














PANDASSSSS

Why Use Pandas?
Data Manipulation: Pandas allows you to clean, transform, and analyze structured data (e.g., CSV files, Excel sheets, databases).
Efficiency: Built on top of NumPy, Pandas is optimized for performance.
Integration: Works seamlessly with other libraries like Matplotlib (visualization), Scikit-learn (machine learning), and TensorFlow/PyTorch (deep learning).
Versatility: Supports a wide range of data formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, etc.).
